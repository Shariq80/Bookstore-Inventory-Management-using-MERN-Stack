# Bookstore-Inventory-Management-using-MERN-Stack
I built a MERN stack bookstore app with components: Book Card, Create Book, Show Book Details, Show Book List, and Update Book Info. Users browse, search, and manage books via a frontend interface. MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js handle data efficiently.
